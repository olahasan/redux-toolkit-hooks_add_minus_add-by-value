## what-i-learned
Through this project:
1. I learned in this project how to create react app and treat with function component,
2. how to deal with redux [Redux-toolkit - counterSlice - store - Hooks - useSelector - useDispatch]
3. how to deal with useSelector-useDispatch
4. how to deploy it on netlify and surge

## Continued Development
In the future, I plan to:
- learn more about reactJs Hooks.
- learn more about redux toolkit with reactJs Hooks.
